# Autonomous Quadcopter Landing System

## Overview

The **Autonomous Quadcopter Landing System** is designed to demonstrate the landing capabilities of a quadcopter using computer vision, sensor fusion, and PID control for stable and precise landing. The system incorporates a variety of technologies and software tools, such as ROS (Robot Operating System), Gazebo simulation, and PID control, to achieve accurate and reliable landings on a moving target.

The system consists of multiple components working together to track a moving target and guide the quadcopter to land safely. It uses a combination of vision processing and sensor fusion to adjust the quadcopter's descent, with a PID controller ensuring that it follows the correct trajectory.

## Key Features

- **PID Control:** A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller ensures that the quadcopter follows a precise trajectory during descent.
- **Vision Processing:** The system uses computer vision techniques to track a moving target and adjust the quadcopter's position accordingly.
- **Sensor Fusion:** Combines data from various sensors (such as IMU and GPS) to improve accuracy and ensure stable flight.
- **Simulation in Gazebo:** The system is tested in a simulated environment using Gazebo, providing a safe and controlled environment for testing.
- **ROS Integration:** The system is developed using ROS, enabling easy integration with other robotic components and providing a flexible framework for development and testing.

## Technologies Used

- **ROS (Robot Operating System):** A flexible framework for building robotic applications.
- **Gazebo:** A powerful simulation tool for testing and visualizing robot behavior.
- **Python:** Used for the implementation of control algorithms and system logic.
- **OpenCV:** Used for image processing and target tracking.
- **PID Controller:** Used for controlling the quadcopterâ€™s descent.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following major components:

1. **Flight Control:** The core logic for controlling the quadcopter's movement during descent, using a PID controller.
2. **Target Tracking:** A computer vision-based module that tracks the moving target, which guides the quadcopter to land.
3. **Sensor Fusion:** A module that integrates data from multiple sensors, such as IMU and GPS, to improve the accuracy of the landing.
4. **Gazebo Simulation:** A 3D simulation environment where the system is tested before real-world implementation.
